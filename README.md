# Gary the Bot

At some point I had the great idea to experiment with coding a discord bot. So was born Gary.

Gary is capable of doing a couple of different things, some of them useful, some of them less so.

Some of Gary's functionally includes and may or may not be limited to:

* Saying 'GARY' at crescendoing intervals of intensity.
* Accessing a 5th Edition DnD API to look up spells.
* Allowing users within the discord chat to roll for initiative.
* Listing the current initiative list.
* Resetting the current initiative list.


To run this bot yourself, you'll need Python 3 and a discord bot/api token.
